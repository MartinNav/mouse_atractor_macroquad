# mouse_atractor_macroquad
This is just simple saturday project, that implements 'gravity' in macroquad.
Please do not expect any gameplay 😁
## How to use
Mouse is attracting the boxes only if you press **left button**, otherwise they continue in their motion.
## ⚠Don't forget⚠
Don't forget to compile with `cargo run --release` or `cargo build --release`, because debug build does have terrible performance.
