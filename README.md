<h1> mouse_atractor_macroquad</h1>
This is just simple saturday project, that implements 'gravity' in macroquad.
Please do not expect any gameplay üòÅ
And also I made it multithreaded because concurrency in rust is really easy to do.
<h2> How to use</h2>
Mouse is attracting the boxes only if you press <strong>left mouse button</strong>, otherwise they continue in their motion.
With <strong>right mouse button</strong> you can spawn more new rectangles.
<h2> ‚ö†Don't forget‚ö†</h2>
Don't forget to compile with <code>cargo run --release</code> or <code>cargo build --release</code>, because debug build does have terrible performance, well it had terrible performance but now it is not that bad, after couple of optimilisations, but still the performance can be improved.
